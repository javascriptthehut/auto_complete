# auto_complete
Build an applicaiton back-end to front-end with a simple but great design, all tested and all in in vanilla js!

## WHAT
We were tasked with building a website with a search bar that autocompletes and pulls words from a saved list in a .txt file.
we added a special feature to help a spanish friend who wants to learn more english!

## HOW

Our .txt file contains a list of words that we will search through once three letters have been typed into the search box.
This will request an array of words that match the first three typed letters, that will gradually narrow down according to the overall letters that are typed in.
the search result will then request more information from an API which will return the word with its translation and meaning in spanish.

## Stretch Goals

get testing badges
get drop down menu css animation
get all the testind done, front to back.
The words will be clickable and will request from a dictionary API the definition of the word to display the return.
connect to one more API.
setting up database on Heroku.
