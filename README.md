Build front-end and back-end auto complete

# WHAT

We were tasked with building a website with a search bar that autocompletes and pulls words from a saved list in a .txt file.

# HOW

Our .txt file contains a list of words that we will search through once three letters have been typed into the search box.

This will request an array of words that match the first three typed letters, that will gradually narrow down according to the overall letters that are typed in.

## Stretch Goals

The words will be clickable and will request from a dictionary API the definition of the word to display the return.
